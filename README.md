## 📌 About the Project

**VidyaSetu** is a web-based academic management system developed during an AI-enabled hackathon, where solving the problem statement using AI tools was part of the challenge.

The system helps manage student records, faculty assignments, lecture scheduling, attendance tracking, marks entry, and performance analytics in a structured and scalable way.

## 🏆 Hackathon Context

This project was built as part of a hackathon where:

- AI tools were allowed and encouraged  
- The problem statement required AI-assisted development  
- Participants had limited time to design and implement the solution  

VidyaSetu demonstrates how AI can be used as a development assistant while maintaining human validation and logic control.

## 🤖 AI-Assisted Development Workflow

1. Problem statement analysis using AI
2. Prompt refinement into structured technical format
3. Multi-AI comparison for optimized architecture
4. Selection of best modular design
5. Manual implementation and validation

AI was used for:
- Architecture planning  
- Code structuring  
- Validation logic suggestions  
- Performance rule generation  

Final testing and integration were performed manually.
